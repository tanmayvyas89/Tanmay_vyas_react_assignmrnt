what is redux?
React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually simple. It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data which your component wants have changed, and re-renders your component.

What is Redux Thunk used for?
Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

What is Pure Component? When to use Purecomponent over
Component?
It is the type of component which re-renders only when the props passed to it changes and not even if its parent component re-renders or if the shouldComponentUpdate()method is called. It is greatly used to enhance the performance of a web application.


What is the second argument that can optionally be passed
